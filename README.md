Be4 is a comprehensive app to motivate you to get off the couch and lace up your running shoes. We provide you with the current weather, some upbeat tunes, a list of breweries as a reward for a great run, and some inspirational words to push you along. Once you’ve finished your run you can log it in the run tracker to see the progress you’ve made.
